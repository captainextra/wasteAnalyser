# wasteAnalyser
Program to parse CSV report and display charts and tables for easy analysis

In my day job, I am responsible for a service charge budget and in this particular instance, my waste contract budget is looking like it is going over budget. I needed a way to look at a CSV report provided by my waste contractor to show me the daily weight collections. In particular, I needed a way to see the General Waste compared with Food Waste in order for me to have evidence and to go to F&B tenants to encourage them to recylce their food waste. This would reduce the general waste bill.
I decided to make a web app using HTML5, CSSÂ£ and Bootstrap 4 for the front end. I used PapaParser to parse the CSV and Highcharts.js for the charts. I used Datatables.js to create the first table on the cover page. 
I have done something similar with thmy Patrolman Analyser using Python/Tkinter, but I wanted experience in the web development area and to make the front end look more polished.
